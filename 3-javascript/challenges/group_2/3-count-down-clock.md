## Learning Goals

The goals of this project are to help you:

- Understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.
- Learn how to incorporate JavaScript into a web page.
- Practice creating and styling HTML elements.
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
- Handle events in JavaScript.
- Create a visually appealing layout using CSS.

## Requirements

- Create a web page that displays a countdown timer.
- Allow users to set the duration of the timer by selecting the plus or minus buttons, for example, 10 seconds.
- Toggle the timer when the circle button is clicked.
- Display the remaining time on the page.
- Style the page using CSS to make it visually appealing.
- Use JavaScript to handle the logic of the countdown timer and update the page accordingly.
- Deploy the website to make it accessible for everyone.

## Technical Details

1. **HTML**: Create the structure of the web page.

2. **CSS**: Style the web page to make it visually appealing according to the design.

   - Use the CSS property `transform: scale(0.75);` to style the clock for mobile screens.
   - You can use the provided shadow values or customize it with your own values.

   ```css
   /* Heading Text Shadow */
   text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #35383f;

   /* Button Shadow */
   box-shadow: 0px 4px 0px 0px #23649b;
   ```

3. **JavaScript**: Write the logic to handle the countdown timer.

   - Select the buttons and timer display elements using `document.querySelector` or `document.getElementById`.
   - Add event listeners to the buttons to detect clicks using `addEventListener`.
   - Implement functions to increase or decrease the timer duration when the plus or minus buttons are clicked.
   - Implement a function to start/stop the timer when the circle button is clicked.
   - Use `setInterval` to update the remaining time every second.
   - Display the remaining time in the timer display element by setting its `textContent` or `innerHTML` property.
   - Clear the interval when the timer reaches zero.

4. **Deployment**: Make the website accessible for everyone.
   - Deploy the website using a service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling the coin flip logic.
