## Learning Goals

The goals of this project are to help you:

- Understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax
- Learn how to incorporate JavaScript into a web page
- Practice creating and styling HTML elements
- Practice manipulating the DOM using JavaScript
- Practice handling events in JavaScript
- Practice creating a visually appealing layout using CSS

## Requirements

- Create a web page that allows users to flip a virtual coin.
- The web page should have a button labeled "Flip Coin".
- When the button is clicked, the coin should randomly display either "Heads" or "Tails".
- Display the result of the coin flip on the web page.
- Style the web page according to the design.
- Ensure the web page is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.

## Technical Details

1. **HTML**: Create the structure of the web page.

2. **CSS**: Style the web page to make it visually appealing according to the design.

   - You can use the provided shadow values or customize it with your own values.

   ```css
   /* Heading Text Shadow */
   text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #35383f;
   -webkit-text-stroke-width: 5px;
   -webkit-text-stroke-color: #35383f;

   /* Button Shadow */
   box-shadow: 0px 4px 0px 0px #23649b;
   ```

3. **JavaScript**: Write the logic to handle the coin flip.

   - Select the button and result display elements using `document.querySelector` or `document.getElementById`.
   - Add an event listener to the button to detect clicks using `addEventListener`.
   - Inside the event listener function, generate a random result ("Heads" or "Tails") using `Math.random`.
     For example:
     ```javascript
     const result = Math.random() < 0.5 ? "Heads" : "Tails";
     ```
   - Display the result in the result display element by setting its `textContent` or `innerHTML` property.
     For example:

     ```javascript
     document.querySelector("#result").textContent = result;
     ```

4. **Deployment**: Make the website accessible for everyone.

   - Deploy the website using a service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling the coin flip logic.
