### JavaScript Instruction

1. Fetch Movie Information from the OMDB API:

- Use the Fetch API to retrieve movie information from the OMDB API.

2. Display Movie or `Movie not found`:

- Write a function to display the movie information or `Movie not found` text based on the fetched data.

3. Add Event Listener for Search Input:

- Add an event listener to the search input to fetch and display movie information when users press enter.

```javascript
// Fetch movie information from the OMDB API
fetch("https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&s=MOVIE_NAME")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    const movies = data.Search;

    function displayMovieInfo() {
      // Function to display movie information or `Movie not found` text
    }

    document
      .getElementById("searchInput")
      .addEventListener("keypress", (event) => {
        if (event.key === "Enter") {
          displayMovieInfo();
        }
      });
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching movie information:", error);
  });
```
