);
```

## Instruction

1. Create HTML Structure:

- Define a form with three steps, each step in a separate div with a class of step.
- Include navigation buttons (Next, Previous, Confirm) in each step.

2. Add CSS Styling:

- Style the form and steps to be visually appealing.
- Use CSS to hide all steps except the current one.

3. Implement JavaScript:

- Write JavaScript to handle showing and hiding steps.
- Add event listeners to navigation buttons to move between steps.
- Handle form submission to show a success message.

### JavaScript Instructions for Multistep Registration Form

1. Create HTML Structure:

- Add form steps with navigation buttons (Next, Previous, Submit).

2. Select DOM Elements:

- `Use document.getElementById` or `document.querySelector` to select form steps and buttons.

3. Show and Hide Steps:

- Write functions to show the current step and hide the others.

4. Add Event Listeners:

- Add event listeners to navigation buttons to move between steps.

5.  Handle Form Submission:

- Prevent default form submission and show a success message.

Here is an example of how you can implement a multi-step registration form using vanilla JavaScript.

```javascript
// script.js
let currentStep = 1;

function showStep(step) {
  // Display current step in the UI
}

function nextStep() {
  // Handle next step function
}

function prevStep() {
  // Handle previous step function
}

document
  .getElementById("multiStepForm")
  .addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert("ðŸŽ‰ Success");
  });

showStep(currentStep);
```
