## Technical Details

To generate QR codes for this challenge, you can use the `qrcodejs` library. You can include the library in your HTML file by adding the following script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/qrcodejs/1.0.0/qrcode.min.js"></script>
```

Once the library is included, you can use it to generate QR codes by creating a new instance of the `QRCode` class and passing the target element and the data you want to encode. Here's an example:

```javascript
const qrCode = new QRCode(document.getElementById("qrcode"), {
  text: "https://example.com",
  width: 128,
  height: 128,
});
```

In this example, the QR code will be generated inside the element with the ID "qrcode" and will encode the URL "https://example.com". You can customize the width and height of the QR code as needed.

Remember to include the necessary HTML elements and CSS styles to create the QR code generator app according to the given design.

## Instructions

To complete this challenge, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up the basic structure of the HTML document.
2. Create a container element to hold the QR code and input field.
3. Use CSS to style the container element according to the given design.
4. Add an input field for users to enter a URL.
5. Create a button element for generating the QR code.
6. Use the `qrcodejs` library to generate the QR code based on the entered URL.
7. Implement the functionality to download the QR code image when the download button is clicked.
8. Implement the functionality to copy the QR code to the clipboard when the share button is clicked.
9. Ensure that the page is responsive by using CSS media queries.
10. Test your application to make sure it works as expected.
11. Deploy your solution to a hosting platform of your choice.
12. Submit the Repository URL and Demo URL for evaluation.

Good luck with the challenge!
