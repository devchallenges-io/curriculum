## Instruction

To add a music player app with vanilla JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. Create the basic structure of the music player app using HTML. Include elements such as an image, title, author, progress bar, and player button.
2. Use CSS to style the music player app according to the given design. You can customize the provided shadow values or use your own.
3. Implement interactivity using vanilla JavaScript. Add event listeners to the player button and progress bar to handle play, stop, next, previous, and play time change functionalities.
4. Use JavaScript to manage the data of the music player app. You can store the song information in an array or object and update the UI accordingly.
5. Test the music player app by playing, stopping, navigating between songs, and changing the play time using the progress bar.
6. Ensure that the music player app is responsive on different screen sizes. Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling as needed.
7. Deploy the solution to a hosting platform of your choice. Provide the Repository URL and Demo URL when submitting your solution.

Remember to test your app thoroughly and handle any edge cases or errors that may occur during usage.

### JavaScript Instructions for Music Player

1. Create HTML Structure:

- Add audio controls, play/pause button, and progress bar.

2. Select DOM Elements:

- Use `document.getElementById` or `document.querySelector` to select the necessary elements.

3. Add Event Listeners:

- Add event listeners for play/pause button and progress bar.

4. Update Progress Bar:

- Write a function to update the progress bar as the audio plays.

5. Seek Functionality:

- Implement functionality to seek to different parts of the audio using the progress bar.

Here is an example of how you can implement a music player app using vanilla JavaScript:

```javascript
// script.js

const songs = [
  {
    title: "Song 1",
    author: "Artist 1",
    src: "song1.mp3",
    img: "cover1.jpg",
  },
  {
    title: "Song 2",
    author: "Artist 2",
    src: "song2.mp3",
    img: "cover2.jpg",
  },
];

let currentSongIndex = 0;
const audio = new Audio(songs[currentSongIndex].src);

document.getElementById("playButton").addEventListener("click", playPause);
document.getElementById("nextButton").addEventListener("click", nextSong);
document.getElementById("prevButton").addEventListener("click", prevSong);
audio.addEventListener("timeupdate", updateProgressBar);

function playPause() {
  // Add pause button implementation
}

function nextSong() {
  // Add next button implementation
}

function prevSong() {
  // Add previous button implementation
}

function loadSong(index) {
  // Add load song implementation
}

function updateProgressBar() {
  // Handle when progress bar is updated
}

document.getElementById("progressBar").addEventListener("input", function () {
  audio.currentTime = (this.value / 100) * audio.duration;
});

// Initial load
loadSong(currentSongIndex);
```
