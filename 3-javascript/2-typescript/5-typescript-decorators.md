# TypeScript Decorators

TypeScript Decorators are a powerful feature introduced to add metadata and modify the behavior of classes, methods, properties, and parameters. These decorators enhance the functionality of your code by enabling declarative programming techniques.

## Understanding TypeScript Decorators

### What are TypeScript Decorators?

TypeScript decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. They provide a way to add metadata or modify the behavior of the decorated item. Decorators work by using functions that apply to the target declaration at runtime.

### How Do Decorators Work in TypeScript?

Decorators are functions prefixed with an `@` symbol. When applied, they receive specific arguments depending on the type of declaration they decorate. The decorator function can then perform actions such as modifying properties, wrapping methods, or even altering class definitions.

### Types of Declarations That Can Be Decorated

Decorators can be applied to various types of declarations:

1.  **Class Declarations**: Enhance or modify class constructors.
2.  **Method Declarations**: Wrap or augment methods within a class.
3.  **Accessor Declarations**: Applied to getter and setter methods.
4.  **Property Declarations**: Add metadata or validation logic to class properties.
5.  **Parameter Declarations**: Modify the behavior of parameters passed to class methods (not available in TypeScript 5.0).

### Syntax and Usage

The syntax for applying decorators is straightforward:

```typescript
function simpleDecorator(target: any) {
  // logic here
}

@simpleDecorator
class MyClass {
  // class definition here
}
```

In this example, `simpleDecorator` is a decorator function. It's a function that takes one argument (`target`), which represents the element that the decorator is applied to. In this case, `target` would be the constructor of the class the decorator is applied to.

The `@simpleDecorator` line is applying the `simpleDecorator` decorator to the MyClass class. This means when `MyClass` is defined, the `simpleDecorator` function will be called with `MyClass` as its argument.

The actual behavior of the decorator is determined by the logic inside the `simpleDecorator` function. In this example, the logic is not specified (`// logic here`), but it could be anything from adding metadata to the class, to modifying the class's methods or properties.

## 1. Class Decorators

Class decorators in TypeScript are a powerful feature used to augment or modify the behavior of classes. When applied, they can add properties or methods to a class, alter its constructor, or perform other modifications. This makes them highly useful for implementing design patterns like dependency injection, logging, and serialization.

### How to Define and Apply a Class Decorator

Defining a class decorator involves creating a function that takes a single parameter: the constructor of the class it decorates. The decorator can then manipulate this constructor or return a new one.

Here's a simple example:

```typescript
function logClass(target: Function) {
  console.log(`Class ${target.name} is being logged.`);
}

@logClass
class ExampleClass {
  // Class implementation
}
```

In this example:

`logClass` is a decorator function that logs the name of the class it's applied to. It takes one argument, `target`, which refers to the constructor function of the class the decorator is applied to.

`@logClass` is applied to the `ExampleClass`. When `ExampleClass` is defined, the `logClass` decorator is called, and it logs "Class ExampleClass is being logged." to the console.

### Use Cases and Examples of Class Decorators

Class decorators are versatile and can be employed in various scenarios:

- **Dependency Injection**: Automatically inject dependencies into a class.
- **Logging**: Add logging functionality to every method within a class.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure that only one instance of a class is created.

Consider this example where we create a singleton decorator:

```typescript
function singleton<T extends { new (...args: any[]): {} }>(constructor: T) {
  return class extends constructor {
    private static instance: T;
    constructor(...args: any[]) {
      if (!singleton.instance) {
        super(...args);
        singleton.instance = this;
      }
      return singleton.instance;
    }
  };
}

@singleton
class SingletonExample {
  // Class implementation
}

const instance1 = new SingletonExample();
const instance2 = new SingletonExample();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // true
```

Here, the `singleton` decorator ensures that only one instance of `SingletonExample` exists at any time.

Understanding how to leverage class decorators effectively can significantly enhance your TypeScript development workflow. Next, we'll explore method decorators and their practical applications.

## 2. Method Decorators

### Overview of Method Decorators

Method decorators are an important feature in TypeScript for changing and improving class methods' behavior. They allow you to intercept method calls, modify method definitions, or even replace methods with new implementations. _Method decorators_ are applied directly to a method within a class, allowing for powerful meta-programming capabilities.

### How to Define and Apply a Method Decorator

Defining a method decorator involves creating a function that takes specific parameters:

- `target`: This parameter refers to the constructor function of the class for a static method, or the prototype of the class for an instance method. It represents the object on which the method is defined.
- `propertyKey`: This parameter represents the name of the method being decorated. It is a string or a symbol that identifies the method within the class.
- `descriptor`: This parameter is an object that contains the property descriptor of the method being decorated. The property descriptor provides information about the method, such as its configurable, enumerable, and writable attributes.

```typescript
function log(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;

  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Calling ${propertyKey} with arguments`, args);
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
  };

  return descriptor;
}
```

Applying the decorator is straightforward. You prefix the method with the `@` symbol followed by the decorator name:

```typescript
class ExampleClass {
  @log
  exampleMethod(arg1: number, arg2: string) {
    console.log("Executing exampleMethod", arg1, arg2);
  }
}

const instance = new ExampleClass();
instance.exampleMethod(42, "TypeScript");
// Outputs:
// Calling exampleMethod with arguments [ 42, 'TypeScript' ]
// Executing exampleMethod 42 TypeScript
```

The `log` decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of the method it's applied to. It takes three arguments: `target` (the prototype of the class), `propertyKey` (the name of the method), and `descriptor` (the Property Descriptor for the method).

The decorator saves a reference to the original method, then overwrites the method with a new function. This new function logs a message with the method name and arguments, then calls the original method with its original context (`this`) and arguments.

The `@log` decorator is applied to the `exampleMethod` method in the `ExampleClass` class. This means when `exampleMethod` is called, it first logs a message, then executes the original method.

### Common Scenarios Where Method Decorators Are Useful

- **Logging and Debugging:** Track method calls and their parameters for debugging purposes.
- **Validation:** Ensure that method parameters meet specific criteria before execution.
- **Caching:** Store results of expensive method calls and reuse them to enhance performance.
- **Authorization:** Check user permissions before executing sensitive operations.

Using _ts decorators_ in these scenarios can significantly enhance code maintainability and readability.

## 3. Property Decorators

### Overview of Property Decorators

A **property decorator** is a special type of decorator in TypeScript that can be applied to properties within a class. Property decorators are primarily used to observe, modify, or initialize a property upon declaration. They provide a mechanism to add metadata or apply validation logic, making them essential in enhancing class properties.

### How to Define and Apply a Property Decorator

Defining a property decorator involves creating a function that takes two parameters:

1.  `target`: The prototype of the class.
2.  `propertyKey`: The name of the decorated property.

Here’s an example of a simple property decorator:

```typescript
function ReadOnly(target: any, propertyKey: string): void {
  Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, { writable: false });
}

class ExampleClass {
  @ReadOnly public exampleProperty: string = "This is read-only";
}
```

In this example, the `ReadOnly` decorator sets the `writable` attribute of `exampleProperty` to `false`, making it immutable.

### Examples of Property Decorators in Real-World Applications

Property decorators find extensive usage in real-world applications, especially when dealing with frameworks and libraries such as Angular.

#### Example 1: Validation Decorator

```typescript
function MinLength(length: number) {
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string) {
    let value: string;

    const setter = (newVal: string) => {
      if (newVal.length < length) {
        throw new Error(
          `The value must be at least ${length} characters long.`
        );
      }
      value = newVal;
    };

    Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, {
      set: setter,
      get: () => value,
    });
  };
}

class User {
  @MinLength(6)
  public password: string;
}
```

In this case, the `MinLength` decorator ensures that the password meets the minimum length requirement before assignment.

#### Example 2: Dependency Injection in Angular

Angular utilizes property decorators for dependency injection using the `@Inject` decorator:

```typescript
import { Inject } from "@angular/core";

class MyComponent {
  constructor(
    @Inject(SomeService)
    private someService: SomeService
  ) {}
}
```

Here, the `@Inject` decorator ensures that `someService` is properly injected into the component.

By leveraging **ts decorators**, developers can create robust solutions that enhance code readability and maintainability.

## 4. Parameter Decorators (Not available in TypeScript 5.0)

### Overview of Parameter Decorators

Parameter decorators are a unique type of decorator designed to annotate the parameters of your class methods. These decorators provide metadata about the function arguments, enabling various advanced scenarios such as validation, logging, and dependency injection.

**Syntax Example:**

```typescript
function LogParameter(
  target: Object,
  propertyKey: string | symbol,
  parameterIndex: number
) {
  console.log(
    `ParameterDecorator called on: ${String(
      propertyKey
    )} at position ${parameterIndex}`
  );
}

class ExampleClass {
  method(@LogParameter param1: string, @LogParameter param2: number) {
    // method implementation
  }
}
```

In this example, `LogParameter` is a parameter decorator that logs information about the decorated parameters when the method is called. The decorator receives three arguments:

- `target`: the prototype of the class.
- `propertyKey`: the name of the method.
- `parameterIndex`: the index of the parameter in the method's parameter list.

### Limitations and Alternative Approaches in TypeScript 5.0

Despite their utility, parameter decorators are not supported in TypeScript 5.0. This limitation restricts developers from directly annotating method parameters using decorators in this version.

**Alternative Approaches:**

1.  **Manual Metadata Management:** Store parameter metadata manually using static properties or external mapping structures.

```typescript
class ExampleClass {
  static paramMetadata = {};

  method(param1: string, param2: number) {
    ExampleClass.paramMetadata = {
      param1Type: typeof param1,
      param2Type: typeof param2,
    };
    // method implementation
  }
}
```

2.  **Higher-Order Functions:** Wrap methods with higher-order functions that handle parameter-specific logic.

```typescript
function logParameters(targetMethod: Function): Function {
  return function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log("Parameters:", args);
    return targetMethod.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class ExampleClass {
  @logParameters
  method(param1: string, param2: number) {
    // method implementation
  }
}
```

These alternatives can mimic some functionalities of parameter decorators while maintaining compatibility with TypeScript 5.0.

## 5. Advanced Usage and Patterns with TypeScript Decorators

### Best Practices for Using Decorators Effectively

To leverage TypeScript decorators effectively, adhere to the following best practices:

- **Consistency**: Ensure that decorators are applied consistently across similar types of declarations.
- **Readability**: Keep decorator logic simple and readable. Overly complex decorators can be hard to maintain.
- **Documentation**: Document your custom decorators comprehensively to aid future developers in understanding their purpose and usage.

### Creating Custom Decorator Factories for Customization and Reusability

Decorator factories enable creating highly customizable and reusable decorators. A decorator factory is a function that returns a decorator. Here's an example:

```typescript
function Log(prefix: string) {
  return function (
    target: any,
    propertyKey: string,
    descriptor: PropertyDescriptor
  ) {
    const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
    descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
      console.log(
        `${prefix} - ${propertyKey} was called with arguments: ${JSON.stringify(
          args
        )}`
      );
      return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    };
  };
}
```

Usage:

```typescript
class ExampleClass {
  @Log("DEBUG") exampleMethod(param1: number, param2: string) {
    console.log("Executing method...");
  }
}
```

### Example of a Well-Typed Decorator in TypeScript

A well-typed decorator ensures type safety and leverages TypeScript's type system. Consider this property decorator example:

```typescript
function MinLength(length: number) {
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string | symbol) {
    let value = target[propertyKey];

    const getter = () => value;
    const setter = (newVal: string) => {
      if (newVal.length < length) {
        throw new Error(
          `The length of ${String(
            propertyKey
          )} must be at least ${length} characters.`
        );
      }
      value = newVal;
    };

    Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, {
      get: getter,
      set: setter,
      enumerable: true,
      configurable: true,
    });
  };
}

class User {
  @MinLength(5)
  username!: string;
}
```

This decorator enforces a minimum length constraint on the `username` property while ensuring type safety through TypeScript's static checks.

## 6. Optimizing Performance and Bundling with TypeScript Decorators

### Understanding the Impact of Decorators on Performance

Decorators in TypeScript add metadata to classes, methods, properties, or parameters. This additional metadata can impact performance due to:

- **Runtime Overhead**: Processing and evaluating decorators at runtime can introduce latency.
- **Code Size**: Decorators generate extra code which increases the bundle size.

### Techniques for Optimizing Decorator Usage

To mitigate performance impacts:

- **Minimize Usage**: Use decorators judiciously to avoid unnecessary overhead.
- **Static Metadata**: Prefer static metadata over runtime computations when possible.
- **Decorator Factories**: Create optimized decorator factories that produce lightweight decorators.

### Interaction Between Decorators and Tree-Shaking During Compilation

Tree-shaking is a technique used to eliminate dead code during the build process. The interaction between decorators and tree-shaking involves:

- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Analysis**: The TypeScript compiler analyzes the AST to determine which parts of the code are necessary. Decorators can complicate this analysis by introducing dependencies that might seem essential.
- **TypeScript Compiler Options**: Configuring the TypeScript compiler effectively can help optimize how decorators interact with tree-shaking. Use `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` options wisely to control metadata emission.

## 7. The Future Scope and Potential of TypeScript Decorators

### Exploring Decorator Metadata and Its Role in Future Language Updates

Decorator metadata in TypeScript provides a means to attach additional information to decorators. This feature has been instrumental in enhancing the capabilities of decorators, facilitating tasks such as reflection and dynamic behavior injection. As an **experimental feature**, decorator metadata is actively evolving, promising more robust and versatile applications in future TypeScript updates.

### Potential Enhancements and Roadmap for TypeScript Decorators

The roadmap for TypeScript decorators suggests several potential enhancements:

1.  **Improved Metadata Handling**: Enhancing the way metadata is stored and accessed can provide richer runtime information, paving the way for advanced techniques like dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.
2.  **Breaking Changes Awareness**: As decorators evolve, developers need to stay informed about breaking changes. The introduction of new features or syntax adjustments may impact existing codebases, necessitating careful planning during updates.
3.  **Integration with New Language Features**: Upcoming TypeScript versions could see better integration between decorators and other language features, ensuring seamless functionality across different aspects of the code.

Understanding these potential advancements prepares you for utilizing decorators effectively in future projects.

## Conclusion

Mastering TypeScript decorators is essential for modern frontend development. They provide powerful tools to enhance your codebase's functionality and maintainability. By understanding how decorators work and applying them effectively, you can improve your development workflow and create more modular and reusable code.
