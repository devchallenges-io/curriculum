# Advanced TypeScript Concepts

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types to the language. This allows you to catch errors at compile time, making your code more robust and maintainable. By incorporating TypeScript into your projects, you can leverage advanced features that go beyond basic type definitions, enhancing the capabilities and safety of your code.

In this lesson, you'll explore _Advanced TypeScript Concepts_, gaining a deep understanding of:

- **Union and intersection types**
- **Type inference**
- **Generics**
- **Type guards**
- **Type assertions**
- **Literal types**

You will also delve into more complex topics such as:

- **Conditional types**
- **Mapped types**
- **Utility types**

Finally, you'll discover the implementation and advantages of using **ECMA Script decorators** in TypeScript.

By mastering these advanced concepts, you can improve your TypeScript skills, write more efficient code, and confidently handle challenging projects.

## 1. Union and Intersection Types

**Union types** in TypeScript allow you to define a variable that can hold more than one type. This is particularly useful for functions that can accept multiple types of inputs. For example:

```typescript
let value: string | number;
value = "hello";
value = 42;
```

_Advantages of using union types:_

- **Flexibility:** Functions and variables can handle multiple types.
- **Enhanced type safety:** Even with multiple possible types, TypeScript provides error checking.

**Intersection types** combine multiple types into one. This allows for creating more complex types by merging properties from various types. For example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee {
  employeeId: number;
}

type Staff = Person & Employee;

const staffMember: Staff = { name: "John", employeeId: 1234 };
```

_Benefits of using intersection types:_

- **Type composition:** Combine the features of multiple types into a single cohesive type.
- **Increased specificity:** Ensure that variables conform to multiple type constraints simultaneously.

## 2. Type Inference

**Type inference** is a feature in TypeScript where the compiler automatically deduces the types of variables and expressions. Instead of explicitly declaring types, you let TypeScript infer them based on the context.

### How Type Inference Works

TypeScript determines types by analyzing the values assigned to variables. For example:

```typescript
let message = "Hello, TypeScript!"; // inferred as string
```

Here, `message` is inferred as a string due to the assigned value. Similarly, function return types can also be inferred:

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
} // inferred return type is number
```

### Benefits of Type Inference

- **Reduces Boilerplate Code:** You write less code while maintaining type safety.
- **Enhances Readability:** Code becomes cleaner and easier to read.
- **Improves Maintenance:** Easier to refactor code without explicit type annotations.

Type inference simplifies development while retaining the robustness of static typing, making it an essential tool for efficient coding in TypeScript.

## 3. Generics

Generics in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allow you to create reusable and flexible components. They provide a way to define functions, classes, and interfaces with placeholder types that can be specified when the component is used.

### Definition of Generics in TypeScript

Generics enable you to write code that works with any data type while preserving type safety. By using generics, you avoid the pitfalls of using `any` type and ensure your code is more robust and maintainable.

### Examples of Using Generics

Consider a simple example of a generic function that returns the parameter it receives:

```typescript
function identity(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let output1 = identity("Hello, Generics!");
let output2 = identity(42);
```

In this example:

- The function `identity` uses a generic type `T`.
- When calling `identity`, you specify the type `<string>` or `<number>`, ensuring type safety.

Another example is a generic class:

```typescript
class GenericNumber {
  zeroValue: T;
  add: (x: T, y: T) => T;
}

let myGenericNumber = new GenericNumber();
myGenericNumber.zeroValue = 0;
myGenericNumber.add = (x, y) => x + y;
```

This class works with any numeric type specified at instantiation.

### Advantages of Using Generics

**Generics offer several benefits:**

1.  **Type Safety:** Ensures the correct data types are used.
2.  **Reusability:** Allows creating reusable functions, classes, and interfaces.
3.  **Flexibility:** Adapts to various data types without losing type information.
4.  **Clarity:** Makes code more readable and easier to understand.

By leveraging generics, you enhance your TypeScript code's robustness and maintainability, making it adaptable to different scenarios while maintaining strict type checks.

## 4. Type Guards

Type guards in TypeScript allow you to narrow down the type of a variable within a conditional block. By providing more specific type information, type guards help ensure that your code is safe and free from runtime errors.

### Explanation of Type Guards

TypeScript's type guards use mechanisms like `typeof`, `instanceof`, and custom type guard functions to determine the type of a variable at runtime:

- `typeof`: Used for primitive types (e.g., `string`, `number`).
- `instanceof`: Used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class.
- **Custom Type Guards**: Functions returning a boolean indicating whether a variable matches a specific type.

### Examples of Using Type Guards

```typescript
function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === "string";
}

function exampleFunction(value: number | string) {
  if (isString(value)) {
    // Here, TypeScript knows 'value' is a string
    console.log(value.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, 'value' is narrowed down to number
    console.log(value.toFixed(2));
  }
}
```

In this example, the function `isString` acts as a custom type guard.

### Benefits of Using Type Guards

- **Enhanced Code Safety**: Reduces runtime errors by ensuring variables have expected types.
- **Improved Readability**: Makes it clear what types are being handled in different parts of your code.
- **Better Developer Experience**: Provides accurate IntelliSense and autocomplete features.

## 5. Type Assertions

**Type assertions** in TypeScript allow you to override the inferred type and specify a more specific or accurate type. They are particularly useful when you know more about the type of a value than TypeScript does.

### Definition and Purpose

Type assertions tell the compiler to treat a value as a specific type, bypassing the default type inference. This is not the same as type casting in other languages; it doesn't perform any runtime checks or conversions.

### Examples of Using Type Assertions

```typescript
let someValue: any = "Hello, world!";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length; // Alternatively
let strLengthAlt: number = someValue.length;
```

In these examples, `someValue` is initially typed as `any`. By asserting it as a `string`, we can safely access its `length` property.

### Best Practices for Using Type Assertions

- **Use Sparingly:** Overusing type assertions can undermine the benefits of TypeScript's static typing.
- **Ensure Accuracy:** Make sure that your assertions are correct to avoid runtime errors.
- **Prefer As Syntax:** The `as` syntax is generally preferred over angle-bracket syntax, especially in JSX code.

```typescript
// Preferred in JSX
let inputElement = document.getElementById("myInput") as HTMLInputElement;
```

## 6. String Literal Types and Numeric Literal Types

**String literal types** in TypeScript allow you to specify exact string values a variable can hold. This is useful when you want to restrict a variable to a predefined set of string values.

```typescript
type Direction = "North" | "South" | "East" | "West";
let direction: Direction;

direction = "North"; // Valid
direction = "Up"; // Error: Type '"Up"' is not assignable to type 'Direction'
```

Using string literal types enhances code readability and ensures that only valid strings are assigned to the variables, reducing potential bugs.

**Numeric literal types** work similarly by restricting a variable to specific numeric values. This is particularly helpful in scenarios where only certain numeric constants are valid.

```typescript
type OneToFive = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
let rating: OneToFive;

rating = 3; // Valid
rating = 10; // Error: Type '10' is not assignable to type 'OneToFive'
```

Numeric literal types provide the same benefits as string literals, ensuring that variables only take on valid numeric values. Using these literal types, you can create more robust and self-documenting code, making it easier for future developers to understand the constraints and intentions behind your code.

## 7. Advanced Concepts: Conditional Types, Mapped Types, and Utility Types

### 7.1 Conditional Types

**Conditional types** in TypeScript allow you to create types that depend on a condition. This is achieved using the `extends` keyword followed by a ternary-like syntax.

#### Definition and Use Cases for Conditional Types in TypeScript

Conditional types enable more flexible and dynamic type definitions. They are particularly useful when you want to narrow down or transform types based on specific conditions. The basic syntax looks like this:

```typescript
 T extends U ? X : Y
```

- `T`: The type to be checked.
- `U`: The condition type.
- `X`: The type to return if the condition is true.
- `Y`: The type to return if the condition is false.

Use cases for conditional types include:

- **Type Narrowing:** Creating more precise types based on certain conditions.
- **Transforming Types:** Modifying existing types into new forms depending on the criteria.

#### Examples Demonstrating the Usage of Conditional Types

Below are some practical examples to illustrate how conditional types work.

**Example 1: Basic Usage**

```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? "Yes" : "No";

type Test1 = IsString<string>; // 'Yes'
type Test2 = IsString<number>; // 'No'
```

In this example, `IsString` will evaluate to `'Yes'` if `T` is a string and `'No'` otherwise.

**Example 2: Type Transformation**

```typescript
type ElementType<T> = T extends (infer U)[] ? U : T;

type Test3 = ElementType<string[]>; // string
type Test4 = ElementType<number[]>; // number
```

Here, `ElementType` checks if `T` is an array type. If it is, it extracts the element type using `infer`, otherwise, it returns `T`.

**Example 3: Nested Conditional Types**

```typescript
type Flatten<T> = T extends any[] ? Flatten<T[number]> : T;

type Test5 = Flatten<number[][][]>; // number
type Test6 = Flatten<string>; // string
```

This example demonstrates nested conditional types to flatten multi-dimensional arrays into a single type.

Conditional types offer powerful ways to create adaptable and reusable type patterns in your TypeScript projects. They enable you to define complex logic directly within your type system, making your codebase cleaner and more robust.

These examples show how you can leverage conditional types for various scenarios, enhancing both the flexibility and maintainability of your TypeScript code.

### 7.2 Mapped Types

Mapped types in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows you to create new types by transforming existing ones. They enable you to iterate over properties of a type and modify them according to specific rules, making your code more flexible and reusable.

#### Explanation and Examples:

##### Syntax:

```typescript
type MappedType<T> = { [P in keyof T]: T[P] };
```

The above syntax iterates over each property `P` in type `T` and retains its type. You can also apply transformations:

- `T` is a placeholder for any type that will be passed when `MappedType` is used.
- `keyof T` generates a union of keys (property names) of `T`.
- `[P in keyof T]` iterates over each property in `T`.
- `T[P]` represents the type of the property in T.

So,`{ [P in keyof T]: T[P] }` creates a new type with the same properties as T and their corresponding types.

##### Examples:

```typescript
// Use-case 1: Creating a read-only
type ReadOnly<T> = { readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] };

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const readOnlyUser: ReadOnly<User> = { name: "John", age: 30 };

readOnlyUser.name = "Doe"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.

// Use-case 2: Creating a partial object
type PartialObject<T> = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P] };

const partialUser: PartialObject<User> = { name: "John" };

// Use-case 3: Picking specific properties from an object
type PickProperties<T, K extends keyof T> = { [P in K]: T[P] };

const pickedUser: PickProperties<User, "name"> = { name: "John" };

// Use-case 4: Omitting specific properties from an object
type OmitProperties<T, K extends keyof T> = PickProperties<
  T,
  Exclude<keyof T, K>
>;

const omittedUser: OmitProperties<User, "age"> = { name: "John" };
```

#### Advantages and Use Cases:

- **Code Reusability:** Mapped types allow you to define transformations once and reuse them across different parts of your application.
- **Type Safety:** Ensures that the transformations are applied consistently, reducing the risk of errors.
- **Custom Transformations:** You can create custom mapped types tailored to specific requirements, like making properties optional or nullable.

Use cases include creating versions of types that are read-only, partial, or have specific constraints. Mapped types offer flexibility and power, enhancing both type safety and code maintainability in TypeScript projects.

### 7.3 Utility Types

**Utility types** in TypeScript are designed to make it easier for you to work with different types of data. They allow you to transform existing types into new ones, giving you more flexibility in how you define and use your code.

#### **Commonly Used Utility Types**

Here are some utility types that are commonly used in TypeScript:

##### 1. **Partial**

The `Partial<T>` utility type is used to make all properties of a type `T` optional. This means that you can choose whether or not to provide a value for each property when creating an object of that type.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const updateUser: Partial<User> = { age: 30 };
```

In the example above, the `Partial<User>` type allows us to create an object with only the `age` property specified, while leaving the `name` property undefined.

##### 2. **Readonly**

The `Readonly<T>` utility type is used to make all properties of a type `T` read-only. Once a value is assigned to a read-only property, it cannot be changed or modified.

```typescript
interface Car {
  brand: string;
  model: string;
}

const myCar: Readonly<Car> = { brand: "Toyota", model: "Corolla" };
myCar.brand = "Honda"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'brand' because it is a read-only property.
```

In the example above, the `Readonly<Car>` type ensures that the properties `brand` and `model` of the `myCar` object cannot be modified after they have been assigned values.

##### 3. **Pick<T, K extends keyof T>**

The `Pick<T, K extends keyof T>` utility type allows you to create a new type by selecting only a specific set of properties `K` from an existing type `T`.

```typescript
interface Employee {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  department: string;
  role: string;
}

const employeeDetails: Pick<Employee, "name" | "role"> = {
  name: "John",
  role: "Developer",
};
```

In the example above, the `Pick<Employee, 'name' | 'role'>` type creates a new type that only has the `name` and `role` properties from the `Employee` interface.

##### 4. **Omit<T, K extends keyof any>**

The `Omit<T, K extends keyof any>` utility type allows you to create a new type by excluding a specific set of properties `K` from an existing type `T`.

```typescript
interface Project {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  deadline: Date;
  budget: number;
}

const projectSummary: Omit<Project, "budget"> = {
  title: "New Website",
  description: "Developing a new website",
  deadline: new Date(),
};
```

In the example above, the `Omit<Project, 'budget'>` type creates a new type that has all the properties of the `Project` interface except for the `budget` property.

Utility types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, and `Omit` are powerful tools that can greatly simplify working with complex types in TypeScript. They allow you to express your intentions more clearly and reduce the chances of introducing bugs in your code.

## Conclusion

TypeScript offers a robust set of advanced features that can significantly enhance your development workflow. By understanding and implementing **union and intersection types**, you gain flexibility in defining variables that can accept multiple types or combine multiple types into one. Embracing **type inference** allows you to write cleaner and more maintainable code by letting TypeScript infer types wherever possible.
