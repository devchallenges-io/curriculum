Creating a new React project with Create React App (CRA) requires Node.js and npm installed on your system. Let's walk through the setup process:

> **Pro Tip**: Make sure you have Node.js version 14 or higher installed before starting.

### 1. Installation Command

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

or with `yarn`

```bash
yarn create react-app my-react-app
```

### 2. Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

or with `yarn`

```bash
yarn start
```

> **Development Server**:
>
> - Runs on port 3000
> - Hot reloading enabled
> - Error reporting
> - Learn more about [CRA development](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts)

The initial project structure created by CRA includes:

```bash
my-react-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│ ├── favicon.ico
│ ├── index.html
│ └── manifest.json
├── src/
│ ├── App.css
│ ├── App.js
│ ├── App.test.js
│ ├── index.css
│ ├── index.js
│ └── reportWebVitals.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

After running the development server, CRA opens your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The development environment includes:

- **Hot Module Replacement**: Changes reflect instantly in the browser
- **Error Overlay**: Displays runtime errors in the browser
- **Source Maps**: Helps debug code in development tools
- **Built-in ESLint Configuration**: Catches common mistakes during development

The development server also provides a build optimization preview and helpful terminal output, showing compilation status and any errors or warnings in your code.

## Setting Up a React Project with Vite

Vite offers a lightning-fast development experience through its modern build tooling. Let's create a new React project using Vite:

> **Pro Tip**: Vite requires Node.js version 14.18+ or 16+.

### 1. Create a New Project

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app
```

or

```bash
yarn create vite my-react-app
```

### 2. Select Project Template

When prompted, choose:

- Framework: `React`
- Variant: `JavaScript` or `TypeScript`

### 3. Navigate and Install Dependencies

```bash
cd my-react-app
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

The generated project structure includes:

```bash
my-react-app/
├── public/
├── src/
│ ├── assets/
│ ├── App.jsx
│ ├── App.css
│ ├── index.css
│ └── main.jsx
├── index.html
├── package.json
└── vite.config.js
```

**Key Differences from CRA:**

- `index.html` lives in the root directory
- Entry point is `src/main.jsx`
- Built-in support for static assets in `public/`
- Simplified configuration in `vite.config.js`

Vite's development server starts in milliseconds and provides instant hot module replacement (HMR). The build tool optimizes your production bundle automatically, splitting code and lazy-loading modules for optimal performance.

To customize your Vite configuration, modify `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
export default {
  plugins: [],
  server: { port: 3000 },
  build: { outDir: "build" },
};
```

## Folder Structure Best Practices for React Projects

A well-organized folder structure is essential for any React project. It helps manage code efficiently, improves collaboration among team members, and allows for easy scalability as the project grows.

> **Pro Tip**: Start with a simple structure and evolve it as your project grows.

### Basic Structure for Small Projects

For small to medium-sized React applications, a simple yet effective folder structure provides clarity without unnecessary complexity:

```bash
src/
├── components/
│ ├── Button/
│ │ ├── Button.jsx
│ │ ├── Button.css
│ │ └── Button.test.js
│ └── Card/
│ ├── Card.jsx
│ ├── Card.css
│ └── Card.test.js
├── hooks/
│ ├── useForm.js
│ └── useAuth.js
├── __tests__/
│ ├── integration/
│ └── unit/
├── assets/
│ ├── images/
│ └── styles/
└── App.jsx
```

This structure follows these key principles:

- **Component Organization**: Each component lives in its dedicated folder with associated files (styles, tests)
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic stays in the `hooks` directory
- **Testing Structure**: Dedicated `__tests__` folder separates test files from implementation
- **Asset Management**: Clear separation of images, icons, and global styles

The benefits of this straightforward approach include:

- **Quick Navigation**: Developers can locate files instantly
- **Predictable Pattern**: New team members adapt quickly to the codebase
- **Maintainable Testing**: Organized test structure encourages consistent testing practices
- **Scalable Foundation**: Easy to expand as project requirements grow

For components that share common functionality or UI elements, consider creating subdirectories:

```bash
components/
├── forms/
│ ├── Input/
│ └── Select/
└── layout/
├── Header/
└── Footer/
```

This basic structure provides a solid foundation for small projects while maintaining flexibility for future growth. The clear separation of concerns makes code reviews more efficient and helps prevent technical debt from accumulating early in the development process.

### Intermediate Structure for Growing Projects

As your React project expands, a more structured organization becomes essential. Here's a scalable folder structure suited for growing applications:

```bash
src/
├── pages/
├── components/
│ ├── ui/
│ ├── forms/
│ └── layout/
├── assets/
│ ├── images/
│ ├── icons/
│ └── styles/
├── utils/
├── services/
└── context/
```

#### Pages Directory

The `pages` directory contains components that represent different routes in your application. Each page component serves as a container for smaller, reusable components.

#### Components Directory

The `components` directory now includes subdirectories:

- `ui/`: Houses reusable UI elements like buttons, cards, modals
- `forms/`: Contains form-related components
- `layout/`: Stores header, footer, navigation components

#### Assets Folder

The `assets` folder organizes static files:

- `images/`: Project images and graphics
- `icons/`: SVG icons and icon components
- `styles/`: Global styles, themes, CSS modules

#### Additional Directories

Additional directories enhance maintainability:

- `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities
- `services/`: API calls and external service integrations
- `context/`: React Context providers and consumers

This structure promotes component reusability and makes navigation intuitive for team members.

### Advanced Structure for Complex Applications

Complex React applications require a more advanced folder structure that can grow with additional features and team members. The feature-based architecture offers an effective way to manage large applications:

```bash
src/
├── features/
│ ├── authentication/
│ │ ├── components/
│ │ ├── hooks/
│ │ ├── services/
│ │ └── types/
│ └── dashboard/
│ │ ├── components/
│ │ ├── hooks/
│ │ ├── services/
│ │ └── types/
│ ├── components/
│ ├── hooks/
│ └── utils/
├── shared/
│ ├── layouts/
│ ├── lib/
│ └── services/
└── core/
├── config/
├── api/
└── types/
```

#### Key Features of the Structure

- Each feature folder contains all related code, making it easier to maintain and test.
- The `shared` directory holds common components and utilities used across features.
- The `core` folder includes application-wide configurations and essential services.

This structure works exceptionally well with lazy loading and code splitting, allowing features to be loaded on demand for optimal performance.

#### Benefits of the Approach

- Reduces cognitive load when navigating the codebase
- Enables parallel development across teams
- Simplifies feature additions and removals
- Promotes code reusability through shared utilities

### Utilizing Path Aliases

Path aliases streamline import statements in React projects by creating shortcuts to frequently accessed directories. Instead of writing complex relative paths:

```typescript
import { Button } from "../../../components/ui/Button";
```

You can use clean, intuitive aliases:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@components/ui/Button";
```

#### Setting Up Path Aliases

**1. Configure `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript projects:**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@features/*": ["src/features/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["src/hooks/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["src/utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Update your build configuration (Vite example):**

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@components": "/src/components",
      "@features": "/src/features",
      "@hooks": "/src/hooks",
      "@utils": "/src/utils",
    },
  },
});
```

Path aliases enhance code maintainability by reducing refactoring complexity and improving import readability. They create a consistent way to reference project files regardless of the current file's location in the directory structure.

## Tooling for Enhanced Development Experience

A robust React development environment requires essential tools to maintain code quality and consistency. These tools automate routine tasks, catch errors early, and ensure a standardized codebase across team members.

> **Pro Tip**: Set up these tools early in your project to maintain consistent code quality.

### Code Formatting and Quality Tools

#### Prettier

- Automatic code formatting
- Configurable rules for consistent code style
- IDE integration for real-time formatting
- Supports multiple file types (JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS)

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 80
}
```

#### ESLint

- Static code analysis
- Identifies potential bugs and anti-patterns
- Enforces coding standards
- Custom rule configurations

```json
// .eslintrc
{
  "extends": ["react-app", "react-app/jest"],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": "warn",
    "prefer-const": "error"
  }
}
```

#### Integration Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev prettier eslint eslint-config-prettier
```

2. Create script commands:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\"",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx"
  }
}
```

#### VS Code Integration

Add these settings to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```

#### Git Pre-commit Setup

Create a `.lintstagedrc` file:

```json
{
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["prettier --write", "eslint --fix"]
}
```

These tools work together to create a seamless development experience. Prettier handles code formatting, ESLint catches potential issues, and Git hooks ensure code quality standards are met before commits reach your repository.

#### Version Control with Husky Hooks

Husky hooks transform your React project's version control into a robust quality assurance system. These Git hooks automate code quality checks before commits and pushes, preventing problematic code from entering your repository.

##### Setting Up Husky

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
npx husky install
npm set-script prepare "husky install"
```

##### Creating Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint && npm run format"
```

> **Hook Benefits**:
>
> - Automated checks
> - Quality control
> - Better code
> - Learn more about [React hooks](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)

This setup runs linting and formatting checks before each commit. A practical example of a `.huskyrc` configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
    "pre-push": "npm run test"
  }
}
```

##### Lint-staged Configuration

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

Husky integrates seamlessly with other tools:

- **ESLint**: Catches code quality issues
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent formatting
- **Jest**: Runs tests before pushing changes
- **TypeScript**: Performs type checking

This automated workflow maintains code quality standards across team members and prevents common issues from reaching your main branches.
