# Custom Hooks: Reusable Logic and Composability

## Introduction

Custom Hooks are a powerful feature in React that have changed the way developers create reusable logic in their applications. These special JavaScript functions, which start with the word "use," allow developers to extract component logic into reusable units, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

> **Pro Tip**: Think of custom hooks as your personal toolkit for building advanced React applications. They combine the flexibility of JavaScript functions with React's state management capabilities.

With Custom Hooks, React's component-based structure becomes even more powerful, enabling developers to:

- Share stateful logic between components
- Reduce code duplication
- Create modular, testable code
- Implement complex state management solutions

Think of Custom Hooks as your personal toolkit for building advanced React applications. They combine the flexibility of JavaScript functions with React's state management capabilities, creating a perfect blend of **reusability** and **composability**.

In this lesson, we will explore Custom Hooks in detail. We will discuss their benefits, best practices for implementation, and real-world applications. You will learn how to create your own Custom Hooks, understand testing strategies, and master the art of composing hooks for complex functionality.

## Understanding Custom Hooks

Custom hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8. They allow developers to extract component logic into reusable functions, making it easier to share and manage code across different components.

> **Pro Tip**: Custom hooks are like building blocks that help you organize and reuse your React code in a clean and efficient way.

### What Are Custom Hooks?

Custom hooks are specialized JavaScript functions that follow a specific naming convention - they must start with "use" (e.g., `useCustomHook`). These functions can call other hooks and can be used to encapsulate stateful logic or side effects.

Here's a basic example of a custom hook structure:

```jsx
function useCustomHook(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  const handleChange = (newValue) => {
    setValue(newValue);
  };

  return [value, handleChange];
}
```

### Key Characteristics of Custom Hooks

Let's break down the core characteristics of custom hooks:

> **Pro Tip**: Understanding these characteristics will help you create more effective custom hooks.

- **Pure JavaScript Functions**: Custom hooks are regular JavaScript functions that can call other hooks
- **Stateful Logic**: They can maintain their own state using React's built-in hooks
- **Component-Independent**: The logic exists separately from any specific component
- **Shareable**: Multiple components can use the same custom hook

### Why Use Custom Hooks?

Custom hooks serve several key roles in React applications:

> **Pro Tip**: Custom hooks help you write cleaner, more maintainable code by extracting complex logic into reusable functions.

- **Logic Reusability**: Extract common logic patterns across components
- **State Management**: Handle complex state operations
- **Side Effects**: Manage operations like data fetching and subscriptions
- **Component Simplification**: Keep component code clean and focused

The power of custom hooks lies in their ability to combine multiple React hooks into a single, reusable function. They can utilize any built-in React hook, including:

- `useState` for state management
- `useEffect` for side effects
- `useContext` for context consumption
- `useReducer` for complex state logic

This composability allows developers to build sophisticated functionality while maintaining clean, maintainable code structures.

## Benefits of Using Custom Hooks

Custom hooks have transformed React development by offering powerful benefits that improve code quality and developer productivity. Let's dive into the key advantages that make custom hooks an essential tool in modern React applications.

> **Pro Tip**: Understanding these benefits will help you make better decisions about when to use custom hooks in your applications.

### 1. Code Reusability

Custom hooks allow developers to extract complex logic into reusable functions. This approach eliminates redundant code across components and promotes a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding practice.

```jsx
// Reusable authentication hook
const useAuth = () => {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  const login = (credentials) => {
    // Authentication logic
    // Example: API call to authenticate user
    apiService.authenticate(credentials).then((userData) => {
      setUser(userData);
      setIsAuthenticated(true);
    });
  };

  const logout = () => {
    // Logout logic
    setUser(null);
    setIsAuthenticated(false);
  };

  return { isAuthenticated, user, login, logout };
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Maintainability

Custom hooks create a clear separation of concerns by isolating specific functionality:

- **Isolated Logic**: Each hook focuses on a single responsibility
- **Easier Updates**: Changes to shared logic can be made in one place
- **Better Testing**: Isolated functions are easier to test and debug

### 3. Cleaner Component Structure

Components become more focused and readable when complex logic is moved to custom hooks:

```jsx
// Before: Component with mixed concerns
const UserProfile = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData()
      .then((data) => setUser(data))
      .catch((err) => setError(err))
      .finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, []);

  // Component logic mixed with data fetching
  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {error && <p>Error: {error.message}</p>}
      {user && (
        <div>
          <h2>{user.name}</h2>
          <p>{user.email}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

// After: Clean component using custom hook
const UserProfile = () => {
  const { user, loading, error } = useUser();

  // Component focuses on presentation
  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {error && <p>Error: {error.message}</p>}
      {user && (
        <div>
          <h2>{user.name}</h2>
          <p>{user.email}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 4. State Management Excellence

Custom hooks excel in managing complex state scenarios:

```jsx
const useCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount((prev) => prev - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);

  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
};
```

> **Counter Hook Example**:

> - State updates
> - Action handlers
> - Value management
> - Learn more about [React Counter Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)

### 5. Encapsulation Benefits

Custom hooks provide a clean API for complex operations:

- Hide implementation details
- Expose only necessary functions and state
- Create consistent interfaces across components

```jsx
// Usage example showing clean API
function CounterComponent() {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Counter: {count}</h3>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increase</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrease</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

Custom hooks handle functionality that spans multiple components:

- Authentication state
- Form validation
- Data fetching
- Theme management
- Device status monitoring

This abstraction creates a single source of truth for these concerns, making it easier to manage and reason about your application.

### Simplified Side Effects Handling in Custom Hooks

Managing side effects in React components can get complicated, especially when it comes to tasks like fetching data, handling subscriptions, or manipulating the DOM. This is where custom hooks come in handy.

#### Handling API Calls with a Custom Hook

Let's take a look at a practical example of how we can handle API calls using a custom hook:

```jsx
function useDataFetching(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}
```

This approach offers several benefits:

- **Isolation of Side Effects**: Components can focus on rendering while the hook takes care of data fetching logic
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management reduces code duplication
- **Loading States**: Consistent handling of loading states across components
- **Reusability**: The same fetching logic can be used in multiple components

Here's how we can simplify our component code using this custom hook:

```jsx
function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const { data, loading, error } = useDataFetching(`/api/users/${userId}`);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{data.name}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> **Component Usage Example**:

> - Clean implementation
> - Error handling
> - Loading states

#### Managing Cleanup Operations with Custom Hooks

Custom hooks are also capable of managing cleanup operations effectively:

```jsx
function useWebSocket(url) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(url);
    ws.onmessage = (event) => setMessage(event.data);

    return () => ws.close();
  }, [url]);

  return message;
}
```

## Best Practices for Creating Effective Custom Hooks

Creating effective custom hooks requires following specific patterns and practices that enhance their reusability and maintainability.

> **Pro Tip**: Following these best practices will help you create more reliable and maintainable custom hooks.

### Naming Conventions

Custom hooks must follow the `use` prefix naming convention. This isn't just a stylistic choice - it's a crucial requirement that React uses to identify hooks:

```jsx
// ✅ Correct naming
const useOnlineStatus = () => {
  // hook implementation
};

// ❌ Incorrect naming
const getOnlineStatus = () => {
  // hook implementation
};
```

### Pure Function Principles

Custom hooks should maintain pure function characteristics:

- Return consistent outputs for the same inputs
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation
- Keep side effects contained and predictable

```jsx
const useCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount((prev) => prev - 1);

  return { count, increment, decrement };
};
```

### Leveraging Existing React Hooks for Composability

Custom hooks gain power through composition with React's built-in hooks:

```jsx
const useThemeAwareButton = () => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  const buttonStyle = {
    backgroundColor: isHovered ? theme.hover : theme.default,
    transition: "background-color 0.2s",
  };

  const handlers = {
    onMouseEnter: () => setIsHovered(true),
    onMouseLeave: () => setIsHovered(false),
  };

  return [buttonStyle, handlers];
};
```

### Single Responsibility Pattern

Each custom hook should focus on one specific functionality:

```jsx
// ✅ Single responsibility
const useLocalStorage = (key, initialValue) => {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  const setValue = (value) => {
    try {
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
      setStoredValue(value);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue];
};
```

> - Local storage
> - Error handling
> - Value management
> - Learn more about [React Hook Storage](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling within custom hooks to prevent silent failures:

```jsx
const useFetch = (url) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Network response failed");
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, error };
};
```

## Testing Strategies for Custom Hooks

Testing custom hooks requires a different approach compared to testing regular React components.

> **Pro Tip**: Good testing practices ensure your custom hooks work reliably across different scenarios.

### Basic Testing Setup

```jsx
import { renderHook, act } from "@testing-library/react-hooks";
import { useCounter } from "./useCounter";

describe("useCounter hook", () => {
  test("should initialize with default value", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter());
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(0);
  });

  test("should initialize with custom value", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(10));
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(10);
  });

  test("should increment counter", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter());

    act(() => {
      result.current.increment();
    });

    expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);
  });

  test("should decrement counter", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(5));

    act(() => {
      result.current.decrement();
    });

    expect(result.current.count).toBe(4);
  });

  test("should reset counter", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(5));

    act(() => {
      result.current.increment();
      result.current.reset();
    });

    expect(result.current.count).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

> - State updates
> - Action handling
> - Learn more about [React Hook Testing](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)

### Testing Hooks with Dependencies

For hooks that depend on external context or providers, you'll need to wrap them in the required context:

```jsx
import { renderHook, act } from "@testing-library/react-hooks";
import { ThemeProvider } from "./ThemeContext";
import { useTheme } from "./useTheme";

describe("useTheme hook", () => {
  test("should use theme context", () => {
    const wrapper = ({ children }) => <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>;

    const { result } = renderHook(() => useTheme(), { wrapper });

    expect(result.current.theme).toBe("light");

    act(() => {
      result.current.toggleTheme();
    });

    expect(result.current.theme).toBe("dark");
  });
});
```

> - State updates
> - Provider usage
> - Learn more about [React Hook Context Testing](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)

## Structuring Custom Hooks in Larger Applications

As applications grow, organizing custom hooks becomes crucial for maintainability.

> **Pro Tip**: A well-organized hook structure makes it easier to find and maintain your custom hooks.

### Directory Structure

A common approach is to organize hooks by functionality:

```bash
src/
  hooks/
    useAuth/
      useAuth.js
      useAuth.test.js
    useForm/
      useForm.js
      useForm.test.js
      validators.js
    useApi/
      useApi.js
      useApi.test.js
      apiUtils.js
    index.js  // Export all hooks
```

> **Structure Benefits**:
>
> - Clear organization
> - Easy maintenance
> - Better testing
> - Learn more about [React Hook Organization](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)

### Hook Documentation

Documenting your hooks helps team members understand their purpose and usage:

```jsx
/**
 * Custom hook for form handling with validation
 *
 * @param {Object} initialValues - Initial form values
 * @param {Function} validateFn - Optional custom validation function
 * @returns {Object} Form state and handlers
 *
 * @example
 * const { values, errors, handleChange, handleSubmit } = useForm(
 *   { email: '', password: '' },
 *   values => {
 *     // Custom validation
 *   }
 * );
 */
const useForm = (initialValues = {}, validateFn) => {
  // Hook implementation
};
```

## Real-World Custom Hook Examples

Let's explore some more real-world custom hooks that solve common problems in React applications.

> **Pro Tip**: These examples demonstrate practical applications of custom hooks in real-world scenarios.

### `useLocalStorage` with JSON Serialization

```jsx
const useLocalStorage = (key, initialValue) => {
  // State to store our value
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      // Get from local storage by key
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      // Parse stored json or if none return initialValue
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      // If error also return initialValue
      console.error(error);
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  // Return a wrapped version of useState's setter function that
  // persists the new value to localStorage
  const setValue = (value) => {
    try {
      // Allow value to be a function so we have same API as useState
      const valueToStore =
        value instanceof Function ? value(storedValue) : value;
      // Save state
      setStoredValue(valueToStore);
      // Save to local storage
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(valueToStore));
    } catch (error) {
      // A more advanced implementation would handle the error case
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue];
};
```

> **Local Storage Example**:

> - State persistence
> - Error handling
> - Value management
> - Learn more about [React Local Storage](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)

### `useDarkMode` for Theme Switching

```jsx
const useDarkMode = () => {
  // Use our useLocalStorage hook to persist dark mode setting
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useLocalStorage("darkMode", false);

  // Use useEffect to handle side effects related to dark mode
  useEffect(() => {
    const body = document.body;
    if (darkMode) {
      body.classList.add("dark-mode");
    } else {
      body.classList.remove("dark-mode");
    }
  }, [darkMode]);

  return [darkMode, setDarkMode];
};
```

### `useDebounce` for Input Handling

```jsx
const useDebounce = (value, delay) => {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set debouncedValue to value (passed in) after the specified delay
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    // Return a cleanup function that will be called every time useEffect is re-called
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
};

// Usage example:
const SearchComponent = () => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");
  const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Only search when debounced value changes
    if (debouncedSearchTerm) {
      performSearch(debouncedSearchTerm);
    }
  }, [debouncedSearchTerm]);

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={searchTerm}
      onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Search..."
    />
  );
};
```
