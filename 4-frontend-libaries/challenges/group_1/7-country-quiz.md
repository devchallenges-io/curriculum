- Build a country quiz app.
- Work with country API to generate quiz questions.
- Display quiz questions with multiple options.
- Provide immediate feedback on user's answer.
- Allow users to navigate between questions.
- Show a congratulations page with the quiz result.

## Requirements

You should create a web page that includes the following elements:

- Create a country quiz that matches the given design.
- By default, generate 10 questions about countries with the given API.
- In each question, users should see 4 options.
- When users select an answer, they should get the correct answer immediately with according indicators in the design.

## Technical Details

To fetch country data for the quiz questions, you can use the [WorldRanks API](https://restcountries.com/). The API provides various endpoints for retrieving country data.

To generate 10 quiz questions, you can make a GET request to the following endpoint:

```bash
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?limit=10
```

For bonus points, you can consider using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js to build this challenge.

  }, []);

  const handleAnswer = (questionIndex, answerIndex) => {
    // Update user's answer for the current question
  };

  const handleNextQuestion = () => {
    // Move to the next question
  };

  const handlePrevQuestion = () => {
