## Learning Goals

By completing this challenge, you will:

- Build a task management app.
- Work with an external JS library.
- Manage data in the app.
- Implement various functionalities like adding tasks, editing task details, adding/removing tags, creating/deleting boards, drag and drop, and toggling between light and dark mode.
- Deploy the solution and submit Repository URL and Demo URL.

## Requirements

You should create a web page that includes the following elements:

- Build a task management app that matches the given design.
- By default, users can see a board with 4 columns (Backlog, In Progress, In Review, and Completed) and a default task in backlog.
- Users can add a new task to Backlog.
- When a task is selected, users can edit the task name and status.
- When a task is selected, users can choose to add a random cover image with a given API or remove the image if it exists.
- When a task is selected, users can add and remove tags. They should be able to choose at least 4 tags like in the design.
- Users can add a new board. When a board is created, it should have a random logo and 'Default board' as the name.
- Users can delete the board.
- Users can drag and drop task cards to different columns.
- Users can see the number of tasks in each column.
- Users can toggle between light and dark mode.
- Deploy the solution and submit Repository URL and Demo URL.

## Technical Details

To build the task management app, you can use an external JS library of your choice. This will help you handle data management and implement various functionalities.

- You can fetch the list of default board lists with the following API endpoint:
  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devchallenges-io/curriculum/refs/heads/main/4-frontend-libaries/challenges/group_1/data/task-manager/list.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devchallenges-io/curriculum/refs/heads/main/4-frontend-libaries/challenges/group_1/data/task-manager/list.json)

- To fetch board data, you can use the following API endpoint for example:
  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devchallenges-io/curriculum/refs/heads/main/4-frontend-libaries/challenges/group_1/data/task-manager/board-1.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devchallenges-io/curriculum/refs/heads/main/4-frontend-libaries/challenges/group_1/data/task-manager/board-1.json)

You should find the endpoints from the board list.

## Instructions for Using a Frontend Library for Task Manager Challenge

### 1. Set Up Your Project:

- Use Create React App to set up a new React project.
- Install necessary dependencies such as axios for API calls and react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality.

### 2. Fetch Initial Data:

- Fetch the list of default board lists using the provided API endpoint.
- Fetch board details using the endpoints given in the board list.

### 3. Create Components:

- Create React components for the task manager, including board, columns and task cards.
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality using react-beautiful-dnd.

### 4. Implement Features:

- Allow users to drag and drop task cards between columns.
- Display the number of tasks in each column.
- Implement a toggle for light and dark mode.

### 5. Deploy the Application:

- Deploy your application using a service like Vercel or Netlify.
- Submit the repository URL and demo URL.

#### Example using React:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import axios from "axios";
import { DragDropContext, Droppable, Draggable } from "react-beautiful-dnd";
import "./App.css";

const fetchBoardList = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devchallenges-io/curriculum/refs/heads/main/4-frontend-libaries/challenges/group_1/data/task-manager/list.json"
  );
  return response.data;
};

function App() {
  const [boards, setBoards] = useState([]);

  const onDragEnd = (result) => {
    // Handle Drag
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Task Manager</h1>
      <DragDropContext onDragEnd={onDragEnd}>
        {boards.map((board, index) => (
          <Board key={index} board={board} />
        ))}
      </DragDropContext>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```js
import React from "react";
import { Droppable, Draggable } from "react-beautiful-dnd";

const Board = ({ board }) => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState({});

  const fetchBoardDetails = async (url) => {
    // Fetch board details
  };

  return (
    <Droppable droppableId={board.id}>
      {/* Implement drag functions */}
    </Droppable>
  );
};

export default Board;
```

## Tech Stack

For this project, you have the flexibility to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or a Front-end library like React, Vue, etc. Consider the learning curve and additional setup required when choosing a library.

Good luck with the challenge!
