- Improve your Frontend skills from beginner to more advanced.
- Implement reusable components and filter functionalities.
- Enhance your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
- Gain experience in creating interactive web applications.

## Requirements

You should create a web page that includes the following elements:

- Create a property listing page that matches the given design.
- Use React or other Front-end libraries for this challenge.
- Create a Reusable Property Card component.
- The card component should include a thumbnail picture, title, description, capacity, price, and rating.
- The card component should render superhost tag conditionally.

- Deploy the solution and submit both the Repository URL and Demo URL.

## Technical Details

To fetch the data for the property listing, you should make a GET request to the following URL:

```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devchallenges-io/curriculum/refs/heads/main/4-frontend-libaries/challenges/group_1/data/property-listing-data.json
```

Here's an example of how you can use the `fetch` API in JavaScript to retrieve the JSON data from the provided URL:

```javascript
fetch(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devchallenges-io/curriculum/refs/heads/main/4-frontend-libaries/challenges/group_1/data/property-listing-data.json"
)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    // Use the data here
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors here
  });
```

### Instructions for Using a Frontend Library for Property Listing Challenge

#### 1. Set Up Your Project:

- Use Create React App to set up a new React project.

#### 2. Create Components:

- Create a reusable PropertyCard component to display property details.
- Create a PropertyList component to fetch and render the list of properties.

#### 3. Fetch Data:

- Use the fetch API to retrieve property data from the provided URL.

#### 4. Render Components:

- Use the PropertyList component to render the list of properties using the PropertyCard component.

#### 5. Filter Functionality:

#### Example Code

```js
// PropertyList

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import PropertyCard from "./PropertyCard";

function PropertyList() {
  const [propertyData, setPropertyData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data and set propertyData
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="property-list">
      {propertyData.map((property) => (
        <PropertyCard key={property.id} property={property} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default PropertyList;
```
