# CSS Custom Properties

CSS custom properties have transformed the way we style websites, offering a level of dynamic and flexible styling options previously out of reach. They promote the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, reduce complexity, and enhance readability in your code.

Custom properties allow authors to define values once and reuse them throughout the document, leading to more maintainable code. They are identifiable with their unique syntax, consisting of two hyphens (--) followed by a name, for example: `--main-bg-color`.

## 1. **Syntax Comparison**

Here's a quick comparison between a regular CSS property and a custom property definition:

- Regular CSS Property: `background-color: blue;`
- Custom Property Definition: `--main-bg-color: blue;`

### **Distinct Features**

CSS custom properties offer several advantages over traditional CSS properties:

- **Reusability:** Use the same custom property multiple times across different selectors.
- **Maintainability:** Update the value in one place to reflect changes site-wide.
- **Readability:** Descriptive names for custom properties make stylesheets easier to understand.

### **Accessing Values**

To use the value of a custom property, you need to use the `var()` function:

```css
.element {
  background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
}
```

## 2. Working with CSS Custom Properties

### Declaration Syntax

To declare a custom property, use two dashes followed by the property name, like `--main-bg-color`, then assign it a value:

```css
:root {
  --main-bg-color: #3498db;
}
```

The `:root` pseudo-class is often used to declare global custom properties that can be accessed anywhere within the document. However, custom properties can also be scoped locally to specific selectors.

### Defining with the `@property` At-Rule

In addition to the standard declaration method, the `@property` at-rule offers an advanced way to define custom properties with added control over their behavior:

```css
@property --theme-color {
  syntax: "";
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: #336699;
}
```

This rule allows you to specify:

- The **syntax** of acceptable values.
- Whether the property should **inherit** its value from its parent.
- An **initial-value** to be used if no other value is specified.

This structured approach ensures that custom properties behave predictably across different browsers and use cases.

### Valid Values

When choosing values for custom properties, consider the context in which they will be used. Since custom properties are not limited by type, they can hold any value accepted by CSS, including lengths, percentages, colors, or even strings without quotes.

### Handling Invalid Values

There may be scenarios where an invalid value is assigned to a custom property. Browsers handle this by ignoring the declaration containing the invalid value. To prevent issues with invalid values:

1.  Provide fallback values using the `var()` function:

```css
.element {
  color: var(--text-color, black);
}
```

2.  Use functions like `calc()`, `max()`, or `min()` to ensure valid computations:

```css
.element {
  color: calc(var(--base-font-size) * 1.2);
}
```

## 3. Accessing and Using Custom Properties in CSS Rule Declaration

Accessing and using CSS custom properties involves a critical understanding of the `var()` function. This function enables you to retrieve the value of a defined custom property. The syntax is straightforward: `var(--name)`, where `--name` represents the name of the custom property.

```css
.element {
  property: var(--custom-property);
}
```

A noteworthy aspect of the `var()` function is its ability to take a second parameter for fallback values. If a particular custom property has not been defined, or its value is invalid, this fallback value comes into play.

```css
.element {
  property: var(--custom-property, fallback-value);
}
```

Envision a scenario where `--primary-color` is undefined; a fallback color can be specified:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--primary-color, black);
}
```

Recognizing how CSS variables cascade is equally essential. Cascading variables follow the same rules as standard CSS; they inherit values from their parent elements unless otherwise specified. This cascading behavior allows for efficient reusability and application of styles within your stylesheets:

```css
:root {
  --font-size: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: var(--font-size);
}

h1 {
  font-size: calc(var(--font-size) * 2);
}
```

In this example, both paragraph tags `p` and heading tags `h1` access the same custom property but apply it differently.

Remember, mastering CSS custom properties necessitates being fluent in declaring, defining, accessing, and using these properties efficiently within your stylesheets. Keep practicing and experimenting with different scenarios to gain a solid grasp of these concepts.

## 4. Scope and Inheritance of Custom Properties in CSS

Custom properties in CSS make stylesheets more dynamic by allowing values to be reused and manipulated efficiently. One important thing to understand is how custom properties work with scope and inheritance.

#### Declaring and Defining Custom Properties

CSS custom properties are usually declared globally using the `:root` selector, which targets the highest-level parent element in the document:

```css
:root {
  --main-bg-color: #333;
}
```

By declaring custom properties within the `:root`, they can be used throughout the entire document. However, custom properties can also be defined within specific selectors to limit their scope:

```css
.container {
  --container-padding: 20px;
}
```

In this example, `--container-padding` is only available within elements that have the class `.container`.

#### Understanding Inheritance and Scope

Custom properties follow standard CSS inheritance rules:

1.  If a custom property is defined in a parent element, it will be inherited by its children.
2.  Overriding a custom property in a child element does not affect the value set on the parent.

For example:

```css
.parent {
  --text-color: #000;
}

.child {
  --text-color: #555; /* Overrides value from .parent for .child */
}
```

The `.child` class will have a different `--text-color` value than its parent due to redefinition. This behavior enables fine-grained control over styling in complex component structures.

## 5. Advanced Techniques with CSS Custom Properties

Harness the power of CSS custom properties to create flexible and adaptive designs by integrating them with media queries. This synergy enables the creation of responsive themes that respond to various viewport sizes, facilitating dark mode implementations and better accessibility features.

#### **Responsive Design Adaptation**

By combining media queries with CSS variables, you adjust styles based on browser dimensions or user preferences. For instance, change font sizes, layout grids, or even entire color schemes when a device switches from portrait to landscape mode.

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  :root {
    --font-size: 16px;
    --container-width: 750px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  :root {
    --font-size: 18px;
    --container-width: 1000px;
  }
}

body {
  font-size: var(--font-size);
  max-width: var(--container-width);
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

#### **Dark Mode Integration**

Dark mode preferences can be easily managed with CSS custom properties. Define color variables for both light and dark themes within media queries that detect user preference.

```css
:root {
  --background-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #000000;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --background-color: #000000;
    --text-color: #ffffff;
  }
}

body {
  background-color: var(--background-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
}
```

#### **Accessibility Enhancements**

Improve accessibility by creating custom properties for font sizes and contrast ratios that adapt to user needs through media queries.

```css
@media screen and (min-resolution: 2dppx) {
  :root {
    --high-res-image-url: "images/high-res-background.jpg";
  }
}

body {
  background-image: url(var(--high-res-image-url));
}
```

These advanced techniques showcase the versatility of CSS custom properties when paired with media queries. They empower developers to build responsive, user-friendly interfaces that adjust not only to device characteristics but also to user preferences and conditions.

## Conclusion

**CSS custom properties** have become a game-changer in web development. They empower developers to create reusable and dynamic styling options, speeding up the development process and improving the quality of the final product.

By providing a way to store and manipulate values within CSS, these properties have completely changed how we approach design, making it more flexible and efficient. Whether it's managing color themes across a website or creating responsive designs with media queries, CSS custom properties have proven to be an invaluable tool.
